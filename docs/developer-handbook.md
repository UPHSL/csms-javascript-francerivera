Development Rule

Implement only the requirements included in the current ticket.

The template establishes the application structure but intentionally leaves
future business functionality incomplete.

## Step 7.5: Add `docs/architecture.md`

```markdown
# JavaScript Express Application Architecture

## Overview

The JavaScript implementation uses Express.js and ES modules.

The architecture separates HTTP routing, request handling, business logic,
persistence, domain models, views, and reusable supporting functions.

## Structure

```text

Responsibilities
app.js

Creates and configures the Express application.

server.js

Starts the HTTP server.

config

Contains shared application and server configuration.

routes

Maps HTTP paths to controller functions.

controllers

Handles Express requests and responses.

services

Contains application and business logic.

repositories

Contains persistence and data-access responsibilities.

models

Represents CSMS domain concepts.

middleware

Contains reusable request-processing behavior.

utils

Contains small reusable supporting functions.

views

Contains EJS templates.

public

Contains browser-accessible static assets.

test

Contains automated application tests.

Request Flow

Not every ticket will require every layer.

Students should preserve clear responsibilities without adding unnecessary
complexity.

Current Endpoints
GET /
GET /health

Unknown routes return HTTP 404.

Starter Scope

Do not implement resident CRUD, persistence, authentication, external APIs, or
other future functionality before the corresponding ticket is released.
